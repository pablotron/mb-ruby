Introduction
============
MusicBrainz (http://www.musicbrainz.org/) is a music metadatabase
similar to CDDB.  MusicBrainz-Ruby is a Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
binding for MusicBrainz.

Installing MusicBrainz-Ruby
===========================
Installation should be fairly straightforward.  Assuming you have both
Ruby and version 2.1.0 or later of the MusicBrainz client library,
simply do the following:

  # ruby extconf.rb 
  # make && su -c 'make install'

If you have RubyGems (http://rubygems.org/) installed, you can also
install MusicBrainz-Ruby like this:

  sudo gem install mb-ruby
